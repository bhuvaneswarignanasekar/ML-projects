# Problem Statement

<h3> Dataset</h3>

- **to predict whether the hotel will be available all around the year**

- Given train.csv and test.csv, train contains features and target variables and test as features variables.

- There are 11 features in the dataset
  - id                          : Hotel id
  - region	                    : Region of the hotel ( eg. Manhattan)
  - latitude	                  : Latitude location of the hotel
  - longitude	                  : longitude location of the hotel
  - accommodation_type	        : Accommodation type includes ( private suite/ shared home/ entire place)
  - cost	                      : cost per night
  - minimum_nights	            : Minumum number of nights
  - number_of_reviews	          : total Number of reviews
  - reviews_per_month	        	: average number of reviews per month
  - owner_id                    : Owner Id
  - owned_hotels	              : Number of hotels owned by the ownder
  - yearly_availability         : Target variable

My work so far is in the notebook, I attained a 90% accuracy by far. I'm still working on this project to find the meaningful pattern or feature that would improve the performance, my approaches will be to form new features with the existing features, find out the most important features.
